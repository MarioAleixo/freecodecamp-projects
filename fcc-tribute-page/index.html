			<h2>The Warrior Queen</h2>

			<div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1" id="info">
				<p>Queen Nzinga (or Njinga) Mbande was the queen of the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms of the Mbundu people (a sub-group of the Bantu people) in what is now Angola.</p>

				<p>Nzinga is said to have been born cerca 1583 in the Portuguese settlement of Angola were should would be later baptised Ana de Sousa Nzinga Mbande. Her father, ngola Kya Samba, was ruler of the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms.</p>

				<p>When her father was dethroned during the 1610s, Nzinga was contender to the throne as, in the Northern Mbundu (Ambundu) culture in which Nzinga was born into, society and descendance were matrilineal meaning she should have become queen. However, her brother, Kya Samba's illegitimate son, seized the throne and forced her to leave the kingdom.</p>

				<p>In 1617, she returned to the kingdom and was tasked with meeting with the Portuguese to negotiate the independence of Ndongo. Depsite agreeing to her terms, the Portuguese did not actually honour them, but one thing that was noted during these negotiations was her political and diplomatic prowess.</p>

				<p>Following both her brother and his son's deaths, she became queen of the Ndongo kingdom. In the 1630s, the leader of the Matamba kingdom died which allowed her to lay claim to that kingdom also.</p>

				<p>For the longest time Nzinga Mbande's life was spent opposing Portuguese rule, as well as that of enemy tribes in her kingdoms. It is known that she continued to lead her armies into battle well into her sixties.</p>

				<p>In 1657, she agreed to a peace treaty with the Portguese and devoted her final years to resettling former slaves and allowing women to bear children.</p>

				<p>Nzinga did not give birth to an heir to the throne, but her sister Barbara of Matamba did succeed her when she died peacefully in her early eighties on 17 December 1663.</p>

				<p>Despite not being nowhere near as well equipped for conflict as the Portuguese, the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms were a great obstacle to the expansion of Portuguese settlements in South Western Africa under Nzinga Mbande's rule.</p>

				<p>Nzinga Mbande should be recognised and remembered for her diplomatic and political prowess, excellent military tactics, and her unrelenting perseverence in fighting for her people.</p>
